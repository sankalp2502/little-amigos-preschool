    <h3 class="page-title">"Nurturing children to reach their full potential"</h3>
    <h4>Why is a pre-school needed?</h4>
    <p>
        Early years (2 to 6) are a unique stage of phenomenal brain development and learning in a child. The capacity to absorb concepts and learn is highest during this phase. Hence it is important to expose the child to a structured environment which will provide adequate and appropriate stimulus for learning.
